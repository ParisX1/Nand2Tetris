x Goes into each folder within /Tests/..., one by one

  Executes: "CompileEngine.py Tests"

x Deletes all the .xml files in 
  C:\Users\tom\Dropbox\MOOCs\Nand2Tetris\tools\CompareTests

x Copies the *.xml files to:
  C:\Users\tom\Dropbox\MOOCs\Nand2Tetris\tools\CompareTests

x Runs TextComparer on each file
  eg  TextComparer.bat 
	C:\Users\tom\Dropbox\MOOCs\Nand2Tetris\tools\CompareTests\main.xml 
      C:\Users\tom\Dropbox\MOOCs\Nand2Tetris\projects\10\CompileEngine\Tests\main.xml
