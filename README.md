# The Elements of Computing Systems
Nand 2 Tetris Systems Course

## Overview

All projects from computer systems course: _Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris_

In the course I built a modern computer from the ground up: using logic gates to build a CPU and memory; created a programming lanuage, assemler and compiler; and developed a basic operating system that can interact with the virtual hardware environment.

## Projects 

The projects from the course comprise:

- `Boolean Logic` Basic logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) combined to create more complex gates (e.g., multiplexers, demultiplexers, adders)
- `Boolean Arithmetic` Designed an ALU to perform basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction)
- `Sequential Logic` Constructed flip-flops, registers, and memory units to store and process data
- `Machine Language` Designed a simple assembly language and created a translator for it
- `Computer Architecture` Built a CPU using the ALU and sequential logic components and integrated it with memory to form a complete computer
- `Assembler` Developed an assembler to translate the assembly language programs into machine language
- `Virtual Machine` Implement a stack-based virtual machine for arithmetic, logical operations, program control and function calling
- `High-Level Language` Developed a high-level programming language called Jack and created a compiler for it
- `Compiler` Constructed the syntax analyzer (parser) and code generation parts of the compiler for the Jack language
- `Operating System` Wrote basic operating system services, including handling input/output and memory management (malloc and free)
