# The Elements of Computing Systems

## Overview

All projects from computer systems course: _Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris_

In the course I built a modern computer: using logic gates to build a CPU and memory; created a programming lanuage, assemler and compiler; and developed a basic operating system that can interact with the virtual hardware environment.

## Highlights

The course logically builds a computer component-by-component.  Highlights of the projects are:

- `Boolean Logic` Basic logic gates combined to create more complex gates (e.g., multiplexers, demultiplexers, adders)
- `Sequential Logic` Constructed flip-flops, registers, and memory units to store and process data
- `Computer Architecture` Built a CPU using the ALU and sequential logic components and integrated it with memory to form a complete computer
- `Machine Language` Designed an assembly language. Created a translator and assembler
- `Virtual Machine` Implement a stack-based virtual machine for arithmetic, logical operations, program control and function calling
- `Compiler` Developed a high-level programming language, constructing the syntax analyzer (parser) and code generation for a compiler
- `Operating System` Wrote basic operating system services, including handling input/output and memory management (malloc and free)
